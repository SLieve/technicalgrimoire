## How Does it Play?

![ezgif.com-MythicMortals.gif]({{site.url}}/images/posts/ezgif.com-MythicMortals.gif)

You play as yourself suddenly granted incredible and unstable abilities. Your powers, weapons, and flaws change every few turns, forcing you to constantly adapt.

![mythicmortals_loadouts_FINAL_CLK-768x576.png]({{site.url}}/images/posts/mythicmortals_loadouts_FINAL_CLK-768x576.png)

You'll be fighting in your hometown, defending your school from monsters, and saving your world from utter destruction. Once you master your powers and your cards, then you will **Be The Hero**!

> "I like the super easy premise. Helps people jump in." - /u/Larmt0r

This system is perfect not only for us busy gamers who no longer have the time for the loooong process of character creation and gaming, but is can be worked for great little bonding adventures that a gaming family can do together." - Chelsey
