      <p>The Stygian Library is an adventure designed for old school roleplaying games written by <a href="https://twitter.com/DyingStylishly">Emmy 'Cavegirl' Allen</a>.</p>
      <p>After you've bought a copy of the book, you can use the buttons to generate levels and events.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/soulmuppet/the-stygian-library-remastered">Get it here.</a></p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 10px;" >Finding the Entrance</h2>
    <p>Only a few locations form a proper connection to the Library and thus can be used to access the place. The requirements are:</p>
    <ul>
<li>It must be a collection of books or similar written works. A library, archive, or perhaps a particularly large bookshop.</li>
<li>It must be large enough that you can’t see all of it from the entrance.</li> 
<li>Somebody must have died there (you can kill somebody and an entrance will appear).</li>
</ul>
<p>Any such space will contain an entrance to the Stygian Library. Any collection of books might contain an entrance if the information inside is interesting or potent enough.</p>
  <p>The entrance to the Library is a simple thing. Somewhere in the library, there will be an unmarked door. It is invariably locked. It is probably hidden, perhaps behind a shelf against the wall, beneath wallpaper, in rooms the public are barred from entering, or under a painting or sign. Find it, unlock it, and on the other side the rows of shelves continue.</p>
